To compile the program:
	javac -cp .:commons-math3-3.6.1.jar Raytracer.java

To run the program: 
	java -cp .:commons-math3-3.6.1.jar Raytracer <driver_file.txt> <out.pgm>

All material files need to be in the same folder as you are executing.

driver02.txt runs in about 10 minutes at resolution 512x512.
Smoothing doesn't work so what's the point of a custom driver file?
